    <h2>Interest In IT</h2>
    <p>
        My interest in IT is video games, specifically the coding side of games and how they are programmed. The other main reason I'm so interested in IT is because most of my life is online, that being friends, entertainment, work, school, etc. My interest in IT started in primary school when we had computer class, where we would learn basic things like typing, microsoft suite apps, google, how to use the internet and things like that.
        <br><br>  One of the main reasons Iâ€™m into IT as much as I am would be my primary school friends that I would play video games with after school. My IT experience consists of multiple years of programming and software development experience in both school and self taught environments, as well as a completed traineeship with game development company Lightmare Studios that granted me a Certificate III.
        <br><br> I chose to enroll with RMIT as it is one of the top IT universities in Australia and it seemed like the best place to go to try and further both my education and my professional career.
        <br><br> I expect to learn a couple of things from my studies here at RMIT, one of those being programming and software development as well as things like more general computer science and computer systems.
