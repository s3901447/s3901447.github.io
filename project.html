    <h2>Project Idea</h2>
    <p>
        My idea for my IT project is a smartphone application that lets you input a value whether that be money in various currencies, or measurements in various units of length, and then lets you convert that value into another. (USD to AUD, cm to inches, watts to amps, etc). The application will be very simple and easy to both use and understand, making it accessible to all audiences, and will be available on all platforms (IOS, Android, etc). The application will also be free to download and include no hidden or visible advertisements.
        <br><br>Everyday people from various jobs and walks of life need to convert various different measurements interchangeably and with multiple different sites for each unit it can be confusing and unintuitive. In the month of July, over 12 million people alone searched for “cm to inches” while trying to convert the difference whereas in the month of July 34.5 million unique users searched USD to AUD. Converting units of measurement is easy as the exchange values never change whereas currency values are changing daily, making it very difficult and unintuitive to find a way to reliably exchange the values on the go.
        <br><br>The application will allow users to input a number value then choose from a drop down box of multiple different units to specify what unit the initial value is. The user can then choose from another drop down box what secondary unit they want the initial value to be converted to. If the initial value and the output value are not compatible (e.g centimeters to USD), then a pop up will appear explaining the problem and why they are not compatible. For unit measurements that have a formula associated with them, the user can scroll down the page and learn about the formula for the conversion between the two units (e.g centimeters to meters would show centimeters * 100). The user will also be able to favorite certain unit conversions for quick use later on and will be able to view these on the favorites page which will be accessible through the drop down menu. The user will also be able to navigate the menu to a formula list that shows common formulas without having to choose the individual units. As currency formulas are constantly changing with the economy, currency data will be taken from websites and applied to the app to allow for accurate currency exchange. One of the limitations of the app is that there are thousands of different currencies in the world that are constantly changing, therefore, there will only be a few of the major currencies implemented in the application (USD, AUD, CAD, etc). The application will also feature a bug report menu that will allow the user to report any bugs found while using the application.
        <br><br>The software I would use to develop the application would be Unity as it is an easy to use and intuitive development software with lots of documentation and support. A working smartphone would also be needed to test the application on, whether that be an IOS device or an Android device. A computer with relatively good specs will be needed to develop and run the application using the Unity game engine as Unity uses a lot of resources and power.
        <br><br>Some of the skills required to develop the application would be a proficiency in C#, JavaScript and basic to intermediate skills in the Unity Editor. Another needed skill would be basic to intermediate knowledge of web development to be able to gather the currency information required for the accurate exchange of various different currencies. As the skills required are basic to intermediate, it will be relatively easy to find or obtain the skills required for the development of the application. As stated before Unity is an open source program with lots of both official and unofficial documentation and tutorials to help both guide and inspire new and advanced users to best complete their projects in both a timely manner and to a very high standard.
        <br><br>If the project is successful, the outcome would be a fully functioning mobile application that is available for both IOS and Android. The application would allow the user to input one value, choose the unit, then convert that value to a secondary unit (cm to inches). One of the secondary outcomes of the successful development of the application would be the learning aspect, as the user can scroll down or navigate to the formulas page and see and learn about the various different conversion formulas between multiple different units. One of the main goals of the application that if the development is successful will hopefully achieve, is the centralization of multiple different conversion methods/sites, i.e having one singular place to look at for anything conversion based instead of having to search up on google or any other search engine the specific unit to unit conversion or currency to currency conversion.
