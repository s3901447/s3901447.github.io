    <h2>Project Idea</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>My idea for my IT project is an innovative smartphone application aimed at simplifying value conversions. With this app, users can effortlessly convert various currencies, measurements, and physical units, such as watts to amps, centimeters to inches, and more. The primary focus of the application is user-friendliness and ease of understanding, ensuring that it caters to users of all backgrounds (vision impaired, etc). It will be compatible with multiple platforms, including IOS, Android, and others, making it accessible to as many people as possible. Also, to make it more appealing, the application will be available for free, and will not include any intrusive or visible advertisements. By using this concept, the aim would be to create a comprehensive and indispensable tool for everyone's conversion needs.</p>

    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>Everyday, people from various jobs and all walks of life often find themselves needing to convert various measurements interchangeably. Unfortunately, the existence of multiple websites for each unit can make this process confusing and counterintuitive. A striking example of this is evident in the search trends of May, where a staggering number of over 12 million people searched for "cm to inches," indicating the widespread demand for a reliable conversion solution. Similarly, a massive 34.5 million unique users sought to convert USD to AUD during the same period. While converting units of measurement is relatively straightforward as their exchange values remain constant, dealing with things like currencies becomes a challenging task due to their daily fluctuations.</p>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The proposed application will provide users with a convenient platform to convert numerical values across various units. Users will have the option to input a number value and select the corresponding initial unit from a dropdown menu. They can then choose the secondary unit to which they want the initial value converted. If the initial and output units are incompatible, such as centimeters to USD, a pop-up message will appear, explaining the issue and the reason for their incompatibility. For unit measurements that involve specific conversion formulas, users can scroll down the page and explore the corresponding formula, such as centimeters to meters (centimeters * 0.01). To enhance usability, users can also add frequently used unit conversions to their favorites list, easily accessible through the drop-down menu. Additionally, a formula list will be available in the menu, offering common formulas without the need to select individual units. To ensure accurate currency exchange rates, the application will retrieve currency data from trusted websites, providing real-time updates. However, given the vast number of currencies worldwide, the application will focus on implementing major currencies like USD, AUD, CAD, and others. This limitation is necessary to maintain data accuracy and usability. In order to improve user experience and address any issues, the application will feature a dedicated bug report menu. Users will be able to report any bugs or glitches they encounter while using the application, facilitating ongoing improvement and maintenance. Overall, the application aims to offer a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for unit conversions. By incorporating conversion formulas, favorite conversions, real-time currency data, and bug reporting functionality, the application strives to be a reliable and convenient tool for users across various industries and backgrounds.</p>

    <h3>Tools & Technologies</h3>
    <p>To develop the application, I would use Unity, a user-friendly and intuitive software known for its extensive documentation and strong support system. Unity provides an ideal environment for application development, ensuring a smooth development process. Furthermore, in order to thoroughly test the application, a functional smartphone is necessary, whether it's an iOS or Android device. Developing and running the application using the Unity game engine requires a computer with decent specifications. Since Unity utilizes significant resources and computing power, a computer with reliable specifications is essential for efficient development. This ensures a seamless workflow and prevents potential performance issues that could hinder the development process. By using the user-friendly features of Unity, testing on a smartphone, and using a well-equipped computer, the application development process can be streamlined, enabling efficient creation and optimal performance of the final product.</p>

    <h3>Skills Required</h3>
    <p>Developing the application necessitates several essential skills, including proficiency in C#, JavaScript, and basic to intermediate competence in the Unity Editor. Additionally, a fundamental understanding of web development is required to gather accurate currency information for exchanging different currencies effectively. The skill set required for the application development falls within the basic to intermediate range, making it relatively accessible and attainable. Unity, being an open-source program, offers abundant official and unofficial documentation and tutorials. These resources are designed to assist and inspire users, regardless of their level of expertise, enabling them to complete their projects efficiently and to a high standard. With Unity's extensive support and the availability of comprehensive documentation and tutorials, both new and advanced users can confidently embark on their projects, completing them in a timely manner while adhering to high-quality standards.</p>

    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <p>If the project is successful, it will result in a fully functional mobile application available for both iOS and Android platforms. The application will allow users to input a value, select the unit, and effortlessly convert it to a secondary unit (e.g., cm to inches). An additional benefit of successfully developing the application is the educational aspect it offers. Users will have the opportunity to explore and learn about various conversion formulas between different units by scrolling down or navigating to the dedicated formulas page. By achieving these goals, the application will provide users with a powerful and user-friendly tool for seamless conversions, while also serving as a valuable educational resource. The centralization of conversion methods will enhance convenience and efficiency, simplifying the process for users who often need to convert values across various units or currencies.</p>
