      <p>
        This job is a senior software engineer for the game company Bohemia Interactive Simulations. The position appeals to me because Bohemia Interactive created the game series Arma, which is a game I've been playing for many years and would love to work at the company who is responsible for creating it. The position is also appealing to me because I would love to work as a developer for a triple A game company even if not working on the game directly.
        <br><br> Some of the skills required for this position are basic senior software engineering skills such as a high proficiency in C++, advanced understanding of algorithms and data structures, and advanced problem solving skills. Another big skill required would be advanced management skills as senior engineers quite often are mentors or teachers to the junior engineers and often collaborate with other departments within the company.
        <br><br> Some of the current skills I have are intermediate proficiency in multiple programming languages such as C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, and Python. I also have some experience working with video game software development such as Unity, GameMaker, and Unreal Engine 4. These skills were learnt both in a school environment, a home environment and from working with a game development company for 6 months.
        <br><br> My plan for how I will obtain the skills and experience required for the position is working with and through RMIT to get my Bachelor Of Computer Science that will hopefully allow me to get a job somewhere as a junior software developer. Alongside that my plan is to work on solo game projects to build up my personal portfolio and skillset.
