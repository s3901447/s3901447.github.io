      <h3>Title</h3>
      <p>Programmer</p>

      <h3>Company</h3>
      <p>Coffee Stain Studios</p>

      <h3>Location</h3>
      <p>Malmö, Sweden</p>

      <h3>Position Description</h3>
      <p>This job is a general programmer role for the indie game company Coffee Stain Studios. Coffee Stain has created many games throughout the years with some of the most notable being Valheim, Deep Rock Galactic and my personal favorite, Satisfactory. I have played and enjoyed these games for years now so I would love to be able to work at the company who is responsible for creating them. The position is also appealing to me because I would love to work as a developer for an indie game company even if not working on the game directly.</p>

      <h3>Skills Required</h3>
      <p>Some of the skills required for this position are basic game programmer skills such as a proficiency in C++, or an ability to write clear, maintainable, portable code. Another big skill required for this position is familiarity and experience with Unreal Engine and developing multiplayer games.</p>

      <h3>Current Skills</h3>
      <p>Some of the current skills I have are intermediate proficiency in multiple programming languages such as C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, and Python. I also have some experience working with video game software development such as Unity, GameMaker, and Unreal Engine 4. These skills were learnt both in a school environment, a home environment and from working with a game development company for 6 months.</p>

      <h3>Plan</h3>
      <p>My plan for how I will obtain the skills and experience required for the position is working with and through RMIT to get my Bachelor Of Computer Science that will hopefully allow me to get a job somewhere as a junior software developer. Alongside that my plan is to work on solo game projects to build up my personal portfolio and skillset.</p>
